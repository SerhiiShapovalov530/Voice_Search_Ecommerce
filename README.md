This project is an attempt at the implementation of an AI Voice Assistant on an E-Commerce website. The basic principle is that in this ecommerce website that sells computer hardware the user will be able to
press the 'Mic' button and describe the product he is looking for. Then through the use of Whisper by OpenAI we transcribe this audio to text and pass it through our machine learning model. As a result
the website returns with the possible products searched by the user.
